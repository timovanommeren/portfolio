We fit a linear regression to examine whether initialization affected the number of relevant records found within the first 100 screenings. The LLM-initialized model yielded on average \textit{B} = 20, \textit{SE} = 8.86, \textit{t} = 2.26. Interestingly, this is approximately equal to number of papers found in the random-initialization condition, at a difference of:, \textit{B} = -8, \textit{SE} = 12.53, \textit{t} = -0.64. In contrast, the difference between the LLM-initialization and the no-initialization conditions was statistically significant: \textit{B} = -20, \textit{SE} = 12.53, \textit{t} = -1.6.
Overall model fit was $R^2$ = 0.44, adjusted $R^2$ = 0.01, and $F(3, 4)$ = 1.03, \textit{p} = $p$ = 0.468.
