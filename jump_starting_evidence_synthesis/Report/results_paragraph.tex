We fit a linear regression to examine whether initialization affected the number of relevant records found within the first 100 screenings. The LLM-initialized model yielded on average \textit{B} = 30.11, \textit{SE} = 0.72, \textit{t} = 41.85. Interestingly, this is approximately equal to number of papers found in the random-initialization condition, at a difference of:, \textit{B} = -0.08, \textit{SE} = 1.02, \textit{t} = -0.08, $p$ = 0.934. In contrast, the difference between the LLM-initialization and the no-initialization conditions was statistically significant: \textit{B} = -9.88, \textit{SE} = 1.02, \textit{t} = -9.71, $p$ < .001.
Overall model fit was $R^2$ = 0.05, adjusted $R^2$ = 0.04, and $F(2, 2613)$ = 62.35, \textit{p} = $p$ < .001.
