	abstract = {Three pillars—harm reduction, demand reduction and supply reduction—underpin the harm minimisation framework of Australia’s drug policy. Much of the activity undertaken by law enforcement is aimed at reducing the availability of illicit drugs and thereby increasing price and reducing demand. This article presents a contemporary, systematic review of research exploring the price elasticity of demand for illicit drugs. Overall, the results indicate that the demand for illicit drugs is, on average, weakly price inelastic—a 10 percent increase in the price of illicit drugs results in a decrease in demand of approximately nine percent. The degree of elasticity varies by drug type, with the greatest elasticity indicated, albeit on a small number of studies, for amphetamine-type substances. The international differences seen point to a need for more Australian research, ideally with robust experimental methodologies and across a range of drug types.},

	abstract = {AIMS: We conducted a systematic review of studies examining relationships between measures of beverage alcohol tax or price levels and alcohol sales or self-reported drinking. A total of 112 studies of alcohol tax or price effects were found, containing 1003 estimates of the tax/price-consumption relationship.
DESIGN: Studies included analyses of alternative outcome measures, varying subgroups of the population, several statistical models, and using different units of analysis. Multiple estimates were coded from each study, along with numerous study characteristics. Using reported estimates, standard errors, t-ratios, sample sizes and other statistics, we calculated the partial correlation for the relationship between alcohol price or tax and sales or drinking measures for each major model or subgroup reported within each study. Random-effects models were used to combine studies for inverse variance weighted overall estimates of the magnitude and significance of the relationship between alcohol tax/price and drinking.
FINDINGS: Simple means of reported elasticities are -0.46 for beer, -0.69 for wine and -0.80 for spirits. Meta-analytical results document the highly significant relationships (P {\textless} 0.001) between alcohol tax or price measures and indices of sales or consumption of alcohol (aggregate-level r = -0.17 for beer, -0.30 for wine, -0.29 for spirits and -0.44 for total alcohol). Price/tax also affects heavy drinking significantly (mean reported elasticity = -0.28, individual-level r = -0.01, P {\textless} 0.01), but the magnitude of effect is smaller than effects on overall drinking.
CONCLUSIONS: A large literature establishes that beverage alcohol prices and taxes are related inversely to drinking. Effects are large compared to other prevention policies and programs. Public policies that raise prices of alcohol are an effective means to reduce drinking.},

	abstract = {Background and aims
Estimating the retail drug market size is complex due to its clandestine nature, yet useful for intervention and policy planning. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) offers an alternative strategy to estimate population-wide consumption trends by analysing influent wastewater, avoiding self-reporting biases associated with other estimation techniques, e.g., consumption or expenditure-based models. This study evaluates the applicability of WBE for drug market size estimation.
Methods
Using WBE data the drug market situation of amphetamine, cocaine, MDMA, and methamphetamine is estimated in European cities (n=75) through combination with price/purity information (Statistical Bulletin) published by the European Union Drugs Agency. Market sizes were estimated at three levels: (L1) pure drug quantities, (L2) adulterated retail drugs quantities, and (L3) market value. Furthermore, yearly consumption estimates from the commonly applied consecutive seven-day sampling is compared to a randomised stratified sampling approach in Brussels, Belgium.
Results
Challenges include the availability and accuracy of price and purity data, which complicates cross-country comparisons and hinders the higher-levels calculations. Due to missing data, the market value (L3) could only be calculated for a limited number of cities, i.e., 39\% (amphetamine), 39\% (cocaine), 1\% (MDMA), and 23\% (methamphetamine). Furthermore, statistically significant differences were shown for amphetamine (up to 139\% measurement error) and methamphetamine (up to 58\% measurement error) between both sampling approaches.
Conclusions
Particularly at city level, WBE can complement traditional market size estimations, but significant uncertainties remain. Future research should expand one-week consecutive sampling to a randomised stratified sampling approach tailored to drug and location.},

	abstract = {Illicit markets persist in places where recreational cannabis has been legalized. This study aimed to identify perceived facilitators/barriers of switching from an illicit to a licit cannabis source. Using a cross-sectional qualitative approach, 529 students, from one New Zealand university, completed a survey investigating the facilitators/barriers to switching through two open-ended questions. Perceived facilitators for switching included: safety (63.1\%); price (42.7\%); legal, no risk of convictions (35.3\%); increased accessibility (32.3\%); product diversity (14.2\%). Perceived barriers included: price (66.4\%); judgement (36\%); regulation (28.9\%); loyalty to current supplier (27.2\%); reduced accessibility (13.2\%). The findings provide recommendations for policies aimed at tipping people in favor of a licit over an illicit source. Avoiding arrest/convictions, and easier access, were not primary facilitators for switching. Thus, providing a licit market might be insufficient in the absence of other competitive factors, such as communicating improved product safety. Competitive pricing and regulation (tetrahydrocannabinol strength/quantity limits) were also barriers. Given legal markets aimed at minimizing harm are constrained with competing in these areas, it is significant that our findings identified other barriers which could be overcome, including limiting surveillance and quantity limits and positioning stores to preserve anonymity. The findings also highlight that loyalty to current illicit suppliers will be a significant barrier.},

	abstract = {Background
For alcohol, regulating availability is an effective way to reduce consumption and harm. Similarly, the higher availability of medical cannabis dispensaries has been linked to increased cannabis consumption and harm. For recreational cannabis markets, such a link is suspected but still poorly understood.
Methods
A systematic literature review (PROSPERO registration number 342357) was conducted on 1 July 2022 in common libraries (Medline, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Psyndex, CINAHL, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane) for publications since 2012. Studies linking variations in the availability of legal cannabis products to behavioral outcomes (cannabis use or related health indicators) were included, while studies focusing solely on the legalization of medical cannabis were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale.
Results
After screening n = 6,253 studies, n = 136 were selected for full-text review, out of which n = 13 met the inclusion criteria, reporting on n = 333,550 study participants and n = 855,630 presentations to emergency departments. All studies were conducted in North America, with the majority from Western US states. Using longitudinal (n = 1), cross-sectional (n = 4), or repeated cross-sectional (n = 8) study designs, an increased availability of legal cannabis was linked to increased current cannabis use and health-related outcomes (vomiting, psychosis, or cannabis-involved pregnancies), regardless of the indicator employed to measure availability (proximity or density) among both adults and adolescents. The positive correlation between cannabis availability and consumption is most pronounced among those groups who have been less exposed to cannabis before legalization. The association between the availability of legal cannabis and risky use indicators was less consistent.
Conclusions
Groups who have been least exposed to cannabis before legalization may be most susceptible to increased availability. In jurisdictions with legal cannabis markets, restrictions on the number of legal cannabis retailers, especially in densely populated areas, appear warranted.},

Characterization of population subgroups based on where they acquire cannabis is unexplored. We examine relationships between sociodemographic characteristics, cannabis use modality, risky cannabis use, and source of cannabis.

Method:
Analyzing a representative sample (unweighted n = 8,089) of U.S. adults living in medical cannabis–permitting states with past-year cannabis use from the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we determined source of last cannabis used. Outcome groups were purchased from a dispensary, purchased from another source, or nonpurchased source. Incorporating the complex survey design, descriptive statistics and adjusted multinomial logistic regressions evaluated associations between sociodemographic, individual cannabis use characteristics, and source of cannabis. Secondary analyses described cannabis purchasing characteristics among the subsample who last purchased cannabis.

Results:
Purchasing from a dispensary was the most common source of cannabis (42.5\%). Significant relationships between sociodemographic characteristics, cannabis use modality, risky cannabis use, and source of cannabis were found. Recent cannabis initiates and those with cannabis vaporizer use had an increased likelihood of purchasing cannabis from a dispensary. Purchasing from a nondispensary source was most likely among those with daily cannabis use, past-month blunt use, past-year driving under the influence, cannabis use disorder, and cannabis and alcohol co-use. Among those purchasing cannabis, joints and other forms of cannabis were more likely to be purchased from a dispensary than purchased from other sources.

Conclusions:
We identified key sociodemographic and cannabis use characteristics that may influence where individuals obtain cannabis, which are important for cannabis behavior surveillance and cannabis use prevention and intervention strategies to consider.},

	abstract = {Background
Ecstasy pills with MDMA as the main ingredient were introduced in many European countries in the 1980s, and were often linked to the rave and club scenes. However, use gradually levelled off, in part as a response to increased concerns about possible mental health consequences and fatalities. Extensive use of MDMA now seems to be re-emerging in many countries. In this study, we investigated the cultural and social meaning associated with MDMA use in Oslo, Norway, with an emphasis on how users distinguish MDMA crystals and powder from “old ecstasy pills”.
Methods
Qualitative in-depth interviews (n=31, 61,3\% males) were conducted with young adult party-goers and recreational MDMA/ecstasy users (20–34 years old, mean age 26.2 years).
Results
Research participants emphasised three important perceived differences between the MDMA crystals and ecstasy pills: (i) The effects of MDMA were described as better than ecstasy; (ii) MDMA was regarded as a safer drug; (iii) Users of MDMA crystals were described as more distinct from and less anchored in out-of-fashion rave culture than those using ecstasy. These differences were an important part of the symbolic boundary work MDMA users engaged in when justifying their drug use.
Conclusion
MDMA has re-emerged as an important psychoactive substance in Oslo’s club scene. One important reason for this re-emergence seems to be its perceived differentiation from ecstasy pills, even though the active ingredient in both drugs is MDMA. This perceived distinction between MDMA and ecstasy reveals the importance of social and symbolic meanings in relation to psychoactive substance use. Insights from this study can be important in terms of understanding how trends in drug use develop and how certain drugs gain or lose popularity.},

The future of these treaties is now uncertain because of decisions by Uruguay, eight US states and Canada to legalize cannabis use. This paper: (1) provides a brief account of the international drug control treaties; (2) outlines the major criticisms of the treaties; (3) analyses critically proposals for treaty reform; and (4) provides a personal view on policies that nation states could adopt to minimize the harms from the use of cannabis, party drugs and hallucinogens, opioids, stimulants and new psychoactive substances. It is argued that: a major risk of cannabis legalization in the United States is promotion of heavy use and increased harm by a weakly regulated industry; some cautious national experiments with the regulation of party drugs and hallucinogens would be informative; a strong case remains for prohibiting the nonmedical use of opioids while mitigating the adverse effects that this policy has on opioid-dependent people; stimulant legalization will probably increase problem use but prohibition is difficult to enforce, highlighting the urgency of finding better ways to reduce demand for these drugs and respond to problem users; and that it is unclear what the best approach is to reducing possible harms that may arise from the use of new psychoactive substances.},

In this paper we examine several cases of policy innovation in the area of economic and social regulation where the influence of foreign models is quite clear: the development of competition policy in Europe in the 1950s, the growth of European Community regulation, and the impact of the American deregulation movement on the telecommunications policies of different European countries. The analysis shows that while utilization of pre-existing models is a common feature of policy innovation, such models are not literally translated into current policy. More or less extensive adaptations to a particular political, institutional and economic context are usually required. We also identify two distinct ways -- push or pull -- in which foreign models can affect domestic policy.},

	abstract = {Multiple factors, including marijuana decriminalization/legalization, tobacco endgame discourse, and alcohol industry pressures, suggest that the retail regulatory environment for psychoactive or addictive substances is a dynamic one in which new options may be considered. In most countries, the regulation of tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol is neither coherent, nor integrated, nor proportional to the potential harms caused by these substances. We review the possible consequences of restricting tobacco sales to outlets run by government-operated alcohol retail monopolies, as well as the likely obstacles to such a policy. Such a move would allow governments more options for regulating tobacco sales, and increase coherence, integration, and proportionality of substance regulation. It might also serve as an incremental step toward an endgame goal of eliminating sales of commercial combustible tobacco.},

	abstract = {Evidence for effective government policies to reduce exposure to alcohol’s carcinogenic and hepatoxic effects has strengthened in recent decades. Policies with the strongest evidence involve reducing the affordability, availability and cultural acceptability of alcohol. However, policies that reduce population consumption compete with powerful commercial vested interests. This paper draws on the Canadian Alcohol Policy Evaluation (CAPE), a formal assessment of effective government action on alcohol across Canadian jurisdictions. It also draws on alcohol policy case studies elsewhere involving attempts to introduce minimum unit pricing and cancer warning labels on alcohol containers. Canadian governments collectively received a failing grade (F) for alcohol policy implementation during the most recent CAPE assessment in 2017. However, had the best practices observed in any one jurisdiction been implemented consistently, Canada would have received an A grade. Resistance to effective alcohol policies is due to (1) lack of public awareness of both need and effectiveness, (2) a lack of government regulatory mechanisms to implement effective policies, (3) alcohol industry lobbying, and (4) a failure from the public health community to promote specific and feasible actions as opposed to general principles, e.g., ‘increased prices’ or ‘reduced affordability’. There is enormous untapped potential in most countries for the implementation of proven strategies to reduce alcohol-related harm. While alcohol policies have weakened in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, societies may now also be more accepting of public health-inspired policies with proven effectiveness and potential economic benefits.},

	abstract = {A major impediment to any nation abandoning the policy of drug prohibition has been the fact that international drug treaties to which the majority of United Nations (UN) member states are signatory prohibit the non-medical use of amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine and heroin. The future of these treaties is now uncertain because of decisions by Uruguay, eight US states and Canada to legalize cannabis use. This paper: (1) provides a brief account of the international drug control treaties; (2) outlines the major criticisms of the treaties; (3) analyses critically proposals for treaty reform; and (4) provides a personal view on policies that nation states could adopt to minimize the harms from the use of cannabis, party drugs and hallucinogens, opioids, stimulants and new psychoactive substances. It is argued that: a major risk of cannabis legalization in the United States is promotion of heavy use and increased harm by a weakly regulated industry; some cautious national experiments with the regulation of party drugs and hallucinogens would be informative; a strong case remains for prohibiting the nonmedical use of opioids while mitigating the adverse effects that this policy has on opioid-dependent people; stimulant legalization will probably increase problem use but prohibition is difficult to enforce, highlighting the urgency of finding better ways to reduce demand for these drugs and respond to problem users; and that it is unclear what the best approach is to reducing possible harms that may arise from the use of new psychoactive substances.},

	abstract = {Background
Much international drug policy debate centres on, what policies are permissible under the international drug treaties, whether member states are openly ‘breaching’ these treaties by changing national regulatory frameworks and shifting priorities away from a ‘war on drugs’ approach, and what ‘flexibility’ exists for policy reform and experimentation at national and local levels. Orthodox interpretations hold that the current system is a US-led ‘prohibition regime’ that was constructed in an extremely repressive and restrictive manner with almost no flexibility for significant national deviations. This paper challenges these orthodox interpretive frameworks and suggests no absolute and clear dichotomy between strict adherence and ‘breaches’ of the international treaties.
Methods
This paper uses historical analysis to highlight the flaws in orthodox policy analyses, which assume a uniform interpretation, implementation and set of policy trajectories towards a ‘prohibition regime’ in the 20th century. It challenges some existing legal interpretations of the treaties through recourse to historical precedents of flexible interpretation and policy prioritisation. It then examines the legal justifications currently being formulated by member states to explain a shift towards policies which, until recently, have been viewed as outside the permissible scope of the conventions. It then examines a functionalist framework for understanding the likely contours of drug diplomacy in the post-UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) 2016 era.
Results
The paper highlights that, contrary to current policy discourses, the international control system has always been implemented in a ‘flexible’ manner. It demonstrates that drug control goals were repeatedly subsumed to security, development, political stability and population welfare imperatives, or what we might now refer to under the umbrella of ‘development issues.’ The paper further demonstrates that policy prioritisation, inherent treaty ambiguities and complexities as well as the recognition of broader issues of security and development were just some of the ways in which member states have flexibly implemented the treaties over the last century. This has frequently occurred in spite of apparent contradictions between national policies and reigning interpretations of international drug control obligations.
Conclusion
UNGASS 2016 inaugurated a new era based on an evolving understanding of the UN drug control system. In this ‘post-‘war on drugs’ era’, national and local policy choices will increasingly hold greater relevance than international ones. Further, based on numerous historical precedents, international legal interpretations will likely continue to evolve and serve a reactive functional role in providing the formal scope to justify national and local deviations from past global norms. These shifting interpretations are, and will continue to be, reflected in an interim reliance on treaty ‘flexibilities’ to explain sustained international cooperation, even as that cooperation shifts to an entirely new implementation framework.},

	abstract = {This paper tries to estimate post-legalization production costs for indoor and outdoor cannabis cultivation as well as parallel estimates for processing costs. Commercial production for general use is not legal anywhere. Hence, this is an exercise in inference based on imperfect analogs supplemented by spare and unsatisfactory data of uncertain provenance. While some parameters are well grounded, many come from the gray literature and/or conversations with others making similar estimates, marijuana growers, and farmers of conventional goods. Hence, this exercise should be taken with more than a few grains of salt. Nevertheless, to the extent that the results are even approximately correct, they suggest that wholesale prices after legalization could be dramatically lower than they are today, quite possibly a full order of magnitude lower than are current prices.},

	abstract = {In society there is a discrepancy that has developed in what the public understands about what Ecstasy is, in relation to the term ‘MDMA’. MDMA, the abbreviation for 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, is the chemical constituent that has most commonly been associated with the street drug known as Ecstasy. Though the use of Ecstasy was reportedly on the decrease, a new product has emerged known as crystal or MDMA powder. This is alongside new competing compounds entering the market, most notably Mephedrone. The research examined explores the changing perception around what the terms Ecstasy and MDMA represent, comparing their popularity and prevalence with that of Mephedrone. This was investigated using an interdisciplinary approach, utilizing methods drawn from social sciences and analytical chemistry. Two online social research surveys were employed to establish what the public knew and understood about the terms, Ecstasy and MDMA and the drug Mephedrone. The surveys included both quantitative questions regarding specific drug knowledge and qualitative questions which asked participants about their reasons behind selecting to use a substance. The surveys provided a social context and highlighted specific perceptions that were held about these drugs. The results from the surveys were compared to seizure data collected from the Cambridgeshire Constabulary, which provided a timeline of the emergence and prevalence of the types of Ecstasy/MDMA and Mephedrone being seized. The perceptions were also compared to a qualitative chemical analysis of seized samples using Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). In the findings from this research there is a definite gap between what the public know and perceive about the terms Ecstasy, MDMA and Mephedrone. A key finding from this research is what is reportedly known about Ecstasy has not translated into what is known about MDMA. There is an observed disassociation between these two terms. Mephedrone, on the other hand appears to have fallen into obscurity post its media high of 2010. The responses to the social surveys indicate a clear preference for MDMA over ‘Ecstasy’ or Mephedrone, as the former is seen as being of better ‘quality’. The user preference was supported by the findings from the seiuzers recorded in Cambridge, with the new crystal form being the most dominant type seized post 2012 and Mephedrone seizures declining after its control in 2010. In reporting the purity of street samples, the public perception was again supported as the crystal materials contained a higher percentage of the chemical MDMA. This is the first reported study of the relative purity of the alternate forms of MDMA.},
