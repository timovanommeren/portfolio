## Preparation

```{r}
# Load penguins
library(ggplot2)

# Read data
penguins <- read.csv("../data/data.csv")

#import function do_addtion from script
source("../scripts/do_addition.R")
```

## Meet the penguins

The penguins data from the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package contains size measurements for 344 penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## Results

A nice little plot.

```{r}
# Plot penguins
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = `Flipper.Length..mm.`, y = `Culmen.Length..mm.`)) +
        geom_point(aes(color = Species, shape = Species)) +
        scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
        labs(
                title = "Flipper and Culmen length",
                subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
                x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Culmen length (mm)",
                color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
        ) +
        theme_minimal()
```

## In line code

Now we're going to calculate the sum of 25 and 25 using inline code: `r 25 + 25`. Furthermore, we're going to report the number of observations in the penguins dataset for the "Chinstrap and Gentoo species repectively: `r table(penguins$Species)["Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)"]`,`r table(penguins$Species)["Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)"]`.

Now for the most important calculation of them all. Flipper length! The average flipper length of all penguins is `r round(mean(penguins$Flipper.Length..mm., na.rm=TRUE),2)`.


## Testing the addition function

We can also use the addition function defined in the `do_addition.R` script to add two numbers together. For example, again adding 25 and 25 gives us `r do_addition(25, 25)`. It works!
