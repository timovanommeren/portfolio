# Timo's portfolio

## Development Repository
Please find the link to my website [here](https://timovanommeren.github.io/Curriculum_Vitae/). You can find my Github repository at [this link](https://github.com/timovanommeren/Curriculum_Vitae). Finally, the request zip file is placed in the exercise_00/05_portfolio folder.

## Research Compendium & Markup Manuscript
Both my research compendium and markup manuscript can be found at in the [jump_starting_evidence_synthesis](https://github.com/timovanommeren/portfolio/tree/main/jump_starting_evidence_synthesis) folder. The contents have been fetched from my thesis repository. Please note that the output of the R code is required to sucessfully compile the manuscript. However, the python code (i.e., the simulation study) does not have to be run in order to run the R code. 

## Shiny APP
Please see the folder titled [shiny_app](https://github.com/timovanommeren/portfolio/tree/main/shiny_app).
