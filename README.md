# Timo's portfolio

## Development Repository
Please find the link to my website [here](https://timovanommeren.github.io/Curriculum_Vitae/). You can find my Github repository at [this link](https://github.com/timovanommeren/Curriculum_Vitae). Finally, the request zip file is placed in the exercise_00/05_portfolio folder.

## Research Compendium & Markup Manuscript
Both my research compendium and markup manuscript can be found at [my thesis repository](https://github.com/timovanommeren/jump_starting_evidence_synthesis/tree/main). Please note that this repository also allows for the replication of my simulation study in Python. However, for the purpose of this course, the statistical analysis and markup manuscript in R should be sufficient. Note that if the python simulation study is skipped, the simulation results should be downloaded from OSF. 

## Shiny APP
I created a shiny app for the analysis on the following github page: [MDMA financial revenues](https://github.com/timovanommeren/MDMA_financial_revenues_quickscan). The resulting webapp can be accessed here: [Shiny APP](https://timovanommeren.github.io/MDMA_financial_revenues_quickscan/)
